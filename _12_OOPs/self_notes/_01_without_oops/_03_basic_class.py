"""Inheritance
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties 
from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the
class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.

The benefits of  inheritance are: 

It represents real-world relationships well.
It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again.
 Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A,
 then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A."""

#Inheritance in Python
"""# Python code to demonstrate how parent constructors are called.

Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species

using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.

#Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). 
It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification 
of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. 
Those types of variables are known as private variables.

A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc."""
