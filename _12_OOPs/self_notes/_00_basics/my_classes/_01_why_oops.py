# Python OOPs Concepts:

"""
In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming
paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement
real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.
The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together
as a single unit so that no other partof the code can access this data.
  """

"""   Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs):
Class
Objects
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance
"""

"""Class :
 
A class is a collection of objects. 
A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. 
It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 
"""

"""Some points on Python class:  

Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute
"""

"""Class Definition Syntax:

#class ClassName:
   # Statement-1
   .
   .
   .
   Statement-N"""


# Creating an empty Class in Python

# Python3 program to
# demonstrate defining
# a class

""" class Dog:
    pass
In the above example, we have created a class named dog using the class keyword."""

"""Objects
The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. 
It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings,
floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any 
single integer or any single string is an object. 
The number 12 is an object, the string “Hello, world” is an object, 
a list is an object that can hold other objects, and so on. 
You’ve been using objects all along and may not even realize it.
"""

"""An object consists of :
State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
"""

"""To understand the state, behavior, and identity let us take the example of the class dog (explained above). 

The identity can be considered as the name of the dog.
State or Attributes can be considered as the breed, age, or color of the dog.
The behavior can be considered as to whether the dog is eating or sleeping.
"""

"""Creating an object:
obj = Dog()
"""

"""The self  
Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. 
We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
"""

"""The __init__ method 
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. 
It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. 

Now let us define a class and create some objects using the self and __init__ method."""
